Python-flask is required for this project. Run 'pip3 install flask' in your terminal to install it
Run 'git clone https://github.com/darrylbckhm/site_template.git' in your terminal to copy the project to your local machine
Start the server by running 'python3 webserver.py' from the root directory, which should contain the file 'webserver.py'
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a web brower
Voila!
Press CTRL+C in the terminal at any time to stop the server from running
Note: Some browsers cache files like Javascript and CSS, so if you make changes and restart the server, there's a chance your browser will be using a cached version. You can delete cached images and data in your browser manually, usually by going to preferences. Or there are ways to add to your code to force the browser to reload (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7413234/how-to-prevent-caching-of-my-javascript-file).
